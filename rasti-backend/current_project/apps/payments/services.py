"""
Payments - Service Layer.

Handles payment lifecycle: start → redirect → callback → verify.

Payment Flow:
1. Customer opens invoice → clicks "Pay"
2. PaymentStartService creates Payment + PaymentAttempt
3. Provider generates redirect URL
4. Customer is redirected to gateway
5. Gateway calls back after payment
6. PaymentVerifyService verifies with provider
7. On success: Payment → PAID, Invoice → PAID
8. On failure: Payment → FAILED, invoice stays ISSUED

IMPORTANT: Customer invoice payments use the COMPANY'S gateway.
Platform billing uses a SEPARATE system (apps/billing/).
